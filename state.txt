Step 1: What is State?
In React, state is an object that holds information about the component that can change over time. Unlike props, which are passed from parent to child, state is local to the component.

State is managed within the component using the useState hook.
State changes trigger re-renders, meaning the UI updates automatically when the state changes.
Syntax of useState

const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);
stateVariable: The current value of the state.
setStateFunction: A function to update the state.
initialValue: The default value of the state when the component loads.
